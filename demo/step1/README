Step1 demo README:
This is the first step of the process, where we analyze molecular dynamics simulations to extract a wealth of information about our simulations. The relevant outputs for step2 are the allosteric hotspots and structural perturbations between states.

Input:
Sample input file, input pdb, and trajectories are given to test run md2pathMain.m and kldivMain.m
A sample residue table for the pdb is provided in the database folder. Other reference structures will be downloaded when running md2pathMain.m or kldivMain.m

Output: 
Expected output for given short trajectories is in md2pathdev folder in 2-D2_BRC_WT. Note that the provided trajectories are too short to output anything meaningful!!!
This also means that pathway calculation will fail starting from the sample trajectories, since entropies would not converge

Running simulations:
gmx_input_files.zip contains all the needed files to run full length simulations on GPU machines
Simulations can also be run on CPU with proper changes to gpu_gromacs.sh

Folder description:
1-D2_DA_WT:
Contains DD2R structure bound to dopamine (DA), which was obtained starting by PDB code 6VMS followed by docking of DA

2-D2_BRC_WT:
Contains DD2R structure bound to bromocriptine (BRC), which was based on PDB code 6VMS

database:
The database folder for AlloCraft. Database contains reference PDBs downloaded by AlloCraft, residue tables for generic GPCR numbering, and FASTA files containing sequences of studied proteins

gmx_input_files.zip:
Input files for running MD simulations of DA and BRC bound DD2R using gromacs
